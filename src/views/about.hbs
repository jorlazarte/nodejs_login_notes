		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Bootstrap Icons is an open source SVG icon library featuring over 1,800 glyphs, with more added every release. They're designed to work in any project, whether you use Bootstrap itself or not. Use them as SVGs or icon fontsâ€”both options give you vector scaling and easy customization via CSS. Take Bootstrap to the next level with premium themes from the official Bootstrap Themes marketplace. Themes are built on Bootstrap as their own extended frameworks, rich with new components and plugins, documentation, and powerful build tools.</p>
